        Oh, the world is not a beautiful place.
        <br>It's not just bright forever.
        <br>I want to keep the abnormal scenery tied up and wear beautiful colored glasses.
        <br>If you do the dance perfectly, I won't come back anymore.
        <br>Please let me take your bruise with me.
        <br>I gave you my sunglasses, so is the price enough?
        <br>Even if it wasn't a parallel relationship, I'd have to say the last word.
        <br>Live by adding color to your gaze.
        <br>Don't leave your body to the painful dance anymore.
